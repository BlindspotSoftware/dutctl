# Project Governance

## Overview

The dutctl project is maintained by [Blindspot Software GmbH](https://blindspot.software). This document outlines how the project is governed and how decisions are made.

## Project Leadership

Blindspot Software GmbH serves as the primary maintainer of the dutctl project and has final decision-making authority regarding the project's roadmap, architecture, and design decisions. These decisions are guided by the specific use cases and requirements relevant to Blindspot Software's business objectives.

## Community Participation

While Blindspot Software maintains leadership of the project, we deeply value community participation and believe that an engaged community makes the project stronger. We actively encourage:

- **Code Contributions**: Pull requests for bug fixes, features, and improvements
- **Feature Requests**: Suggestions for new capabilities and enhancements
- **Issue Reports**: Detailed bug reports and documentation improvements
- **Design Input**: Ideas and discussions about project direction and architecture

## Decision Making Process

Decision making follows these general principles:

1. **Open Discussion**: Major changes and features are discussed openly in issues or pull requests
2. **Technical Merit**: Decisions prioritize technical excellence, security, and maintainability
3. **Alignment with Project Goals**: Changes should align with the core mission of dutctl
4. **Business Requirements**: Blindspot Software will prioritize features that support relevant business use cases

## Conflict Resolution

In case of disagreements:

1. Seek consensus through respectful discussion in the relevant issue or PR
2. If consensus cannot be reached, Blindspot Software maintainers will make the final decision
3. All participants are expected to adhere to the project's code of conduct

## Evolution of Governance

This governance model may evolve as the project grows. Changes to governance will be documented and communicated to the community.

While Blindspot Software GmbH maintains leadership of the project, we are committed to fostering an open, inclusive, and collaborative community. We believe that by working together—company and community—we can create the most robust and useful tool possible.
